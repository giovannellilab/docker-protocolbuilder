This is a [docker](https://www.docker.com) container intended for building electronic books from [pandoc's markdown flavor](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) by using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), [`R`](http://www.r-project.org/), and [TeX Live](http://tug.org/texlive/). It has pre-installed the `R` package [`bookbuildeR`](http://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuildeR) which provides an infrastructure and additional commands to deal with hierarchically structured books and documents.
