Docker Container for Building and Building Electronic Books from Pandoc Markdown

This is a [docker](https://www.docker.com) container intended for building electronic books from [pandoc's markdown flavor](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) by using, well, [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and [`R`](http://www.r-project.org/). It thus contains [texlive](http://tug.org/texlive/), pandoc, `R`, and some other tools, such as the `R` package [`bookbuildeR`](http://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuildeR) which provides an infrastructure and additional commands to deal with hierarchically structured books and documents.
